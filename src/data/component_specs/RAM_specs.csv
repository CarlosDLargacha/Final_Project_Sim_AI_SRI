Sleek and stylish aluminum heatspreader design. Intel XMP 2.0 support. Do not mix memory kits. Memory kits are sold in matched kits that are designed to run together as a set. Mixing memory kits will result in stability issues or system failure. Memory kits will boot at the SPD speed at default BIOS settings with compatible hardware. For memory kits with XMP, enable XMP/DOCP/A-XMP in BIOS to reach the rated potential XMP overclock speed of the memory kit, subject to the use of compatible hardware. Reaching the rated XMP overclock speed and system stability will depend on the compatibility and capability of the motherboard and CPU used. Usage in any manner inconsistent with manufacturer specifications, warnings, designs, or recommendations will result lower speeds, system instability, or damage to the system or its components.
