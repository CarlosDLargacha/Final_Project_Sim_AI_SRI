Desktop drives vs. WD Red Pro Do right by your NAS and choose the drive purpose-built for NAS with an array of features to help preserve your data and maintain optimum performance. Take the following into consideration when choosing a hard drive for your NAS: - Compatibility: Unlike desktop drives, these drives are specifically tested for compatibility with NAS systems for optimum performance. - Reliability: The always-on environment of a NAS or RAID is a hot one, and desktop drives aren't typically designed and tested under those conditions like WD Red Pro drives are. - Error Recovery Controls: WD Red Pro NAS hard drives are specifically designed with RAID error recovery control to help reduce failures within the NAS system. - Noise and Vibration Protection: Designed to operate solo, desktop drives typically offer little or no protection from the noise and vibration present in a multi-drive system.

Extended Drive Testing A NAS environment that has up to 24 bays is very demanding on a hard drive with added vibration and heat. This is why every WD Red Pro drive is shipped with extended thermal cycle burn-in testing to help ensure each drive is tested for extended reliable operation. Desktop drives vs. WD Red Pro Do right by your NAS and choose the drive purpose-built for NAS with an array of features to help preserve your data and maintain optimum performance. Take the following into consideration when choosing a hard drive for your NAS: - Compatibility: Unlike desktop drives, these drives are specifically tested for compatibility with NAS systems for optimum performance. - Reliability: The always-on environment of a NAS or RAID is a hot one, and desktop drives aren't typically designed and tested under those conditions like WD Red Pro drives are. - Error Recovery Controls: WD Red Pro NAS hard drives are specifically designed with RAID error recovery control to help reduce failures within the NAS system. - Noise and Vibration Protection: Designed to operate solo, desktop drives typically offer little or no protection from the noise and vibration present in a multi-drive system.
